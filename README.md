# Mocha Enzyme React Babel WebPack

**tldr;** meh

This was a very ad-hoc thing and had some trial and error. The behavior seems slightly inconsistent with how Jest interacts with the dom.

It is harder because there are just so many things to setup for css loading and static assets, etc. create-react-app   is just a hell of a lot easier.

Mocha seems just ok.
